# itado3i Port Scanner 🔍

A Python-based **TCP Port Scanner** I built as part of my penetration testing learning journey.  
This project focuses on **network reconnaissance basics** — identifying open ports and the services running on them.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Scans common TCP ports (1–1024)
- Resolves hostnames to IP addresses
- Identifies basic services with `socket.getservbyport`
- Outputs results to console and `portscanner.txt`
- Measures total scan time

## ⚙️ Usage
Run the script with Python:

```bash
python scanner.py
